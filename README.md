# darmok-core-logic

A Clojure library designed to demonstrate the use of core.logic using examples relating to the Darmok Star Trek:TNG episode.

## Usage

The darmok-core-logic.core namespace defines the constraints based on the Tamarian language and its translation using core.logic. Using these constraints a generator function is built that builds up a story based on Tamarian phrases and its translations.

The darmok-core-logic.demo namespace shows the example usage of the generator and the underlying functions.
